-event handlers are themselves async
-more like callbacks too

-XMLHttpRequest api is async

-sync programming completes code one line at a time (finishing line then move on)
-async lets the code put off something while the rest finishes then completes when it's ready (?)

-"i will finish later!" 
-start long-running tasks and continue others at the same time

Ex: setTimeout, callbacks, promises
